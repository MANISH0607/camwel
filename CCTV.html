                        <p>Can record straight to a video tape recorder which are able to record analogue signals as
                            pictures. If the analogue signals are recorded to tape, then the tape must run at a very
                            slow speed in order to operate continuously. This is because in order to allow a three-hour
                            tape to run for 24 hours, it must be set to run on a time lapse basis which is usually about
                            four frames a second. In one second, the camera scene can change dramatically. A person for
                            example can have walked a distance of 1 meter, and therefore if the distance is divided into
                            four parts, i.e. four frames or "snapshots" in time, then each frame invariably looks like a
                            blur, unless the subject keeps relatively still. Analogue signals can also be converted into
                            a digital signal to enable the recordings to be stored on a PC as digital recordings.

                        <p>Wiring and cable might not be the flashiest part of a security system but it is a critical
                            part of the overall solution. There are plenty of things to consider when selecting and
                            installing wire and cable to ensure your security system works optimally. At a minimum, wire
                            will be used to provide power to your camera installation and most of the time, wire is also
                            used to transmit the video camera signal back to the DVR. To determine the appropriate cable
                            for your security camera installation you must first know whether your system is analog or
                            digital. Next, you need to know if your camera is going to be powered locally (connecting to
                            it's power source within a few feet) or remotely. If you are connecting the camera to a
                            remote power source, you should consider running your video and power cables together. Video
                            security cables are available with the power and video cables run side-by-side (known as
                            Siamese Cables) or all under one jacket. These will make installation much easier than
                            trying to pull two separate wires.
